## Alternatives

This tool is no longer maintained, but there are several alternatives you can use:
 - Check out [friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer) with its `native_function_invocation` option.
 - Check out the maintained fork at https://github.com/T-Regx/fqn-check if you just want a small tool to check for fully qualified function calls.
